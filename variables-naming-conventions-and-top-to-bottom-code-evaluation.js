/*

Objective:
In this activity, you will reinforce the skill of creating and using variables
while practicing best practices in variable naming conventions through a hands-on,
interactive coding challenge.

The code snippet below may include:
  - Ambiguous or incorrect variable names.
  - Missing variables that need to be created.
  - Scenarios that require the use of clear and descriptive variable names.

You will:
  - Identify Issues: Review the provided code and identify any variable names that:
  - Are unclear or too vague (e.g., a, b, c).
  - Do not follow best practices (e.g., camelCase, descriptive naming).
  - Refactor the Code: Rename the variables and rewrite the program using descriptive names that clearly convey the variable's purpose.
  - Enhance the Program: Add at least two additional variables to improve the programâ€™s functionality or clarity.

Things to reflect on:
  - Why is it important to use meaningful variable names?
  - What are the common pitfalls to avoid when naming variables?
  - How do clear variable names benefit team collaboration?

// let a = "Alice";
// let b = 5;
// let c = 20;
// let d = a + " bought " + b + " items for $" + c + ".";

// console.log(d);

let name="Alice";
let numberOfItems=5;
let totalAmount=20;
let transactionDetails=name+"bouthg"+numberOfItems+"items for $"+""+totalAmount+".";
console.log(transactionDetails);

// To use meanigful vaiable names a lot for the other programmers to understand the code easily.
// Avoid usng single letters as a varable name. The pittfalls to avoid when nameing vaiables are using single letter.
// Clear vaiable name benefit team collaborating by maing the code easy to understand.
